    "# Introduction\n",
    "This first project is based on Chapter 2 of \"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow\" by Aurélien Géron.\n",
    "It is intended as a copy-pasted project to try and confirm that the concept of this chapter were correctly assimilated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direction\n",
    "The intent of this ML project is to predict the price of houses in a given California district. This output should be a numerical value in US dollars, and the input data is block data from the US census bureau."
